An Android library management application using Java in Android Studio to streamline book borrowing, returning, and inventory tracking. Integrated a remote MySQL database using JDBC for secure data storage and retrieval, supporting features like user authentication and book search. Designed an intuitive UI with Material Design and applied MVVM architecture for maintainability. Managed build automation with Gradle and version control with Git. This project honed my skills in mobile app development, database integration, and client-server communication.
